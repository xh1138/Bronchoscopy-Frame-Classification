# Bronchoscopy Frame Classification with Contrastive Learning and Pseudo-Labeling

This repository presents the **core design and logic** behind a medical image classification project,
which aims to distinguish *informative* vs *uninformative* bronchoscopy frames.
The code is structured to highlight model design, contrastive loss, pseudo-label integration,
and feature-center updates under noisy and unlabeled conditions.

> **Note**
> This repository is a *demonstration-only* version for academic purposes.  
> It shows the algorithmic and structural design, not a fully runnable implementation.  
> All data paths and lab-specific components have been removed for confidentiality.

### üîç Core Ideas
- Class-center guided **contrastive learning** to improve robustness under noisy supervision  
- **Pseudo-labeling** for leveraging unlabeled medical frames  
- Dynamic **class center updates** during training for representation consistency  
- Joint optimization of classification and contrastive objectives
